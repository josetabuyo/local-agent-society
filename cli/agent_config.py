"""`.las-agent.json` — the agent-owned config file, and its `sessions` section.

Shared by the CLI (`las agent new`, `las agent target`) and the backend
(`GET/PATCH /agents/{name}/config`, session routing) so the schema lives in
exactly one place. See docs/adr/0005-nested-mailboxes.md.

An agent's connected runtimes (a Claude, a Codex, a plain shell — its
*sessions*, docs/adr/0004) are its children queues. Where an inbound message
goes when the sender does not say, and how each child is described to a
router, is the agent's own business, so it is declared here, in its file:

    "sessions": {
      "target": "default" | "all" | "<runtime>" | "<sid>",
      "cc_default": false,
      "runtimes": {
        "shell": {"intelligent": false, "accepts": ["command"], "scope": "..."},
        ...
      }
    }

- `target` — where a plain send (and the widget mic) lands: the last-used
  session (`default`, via the agent mailbox), every connected session
  (`all`), or one runtime / session id. A configured target that is not
  connected falls back to the agent mailbox, so nothing is ever lost.
- `cc_default` — when the message went somewhere other than the default
  session, also hand the default (usually the intelligent one) a
  for-the-record copy (`kind: "cc"`), so it keeps track of what the human
  told the shell.
- `runtimes` — one descriptor per runtime kind: whether it understands
  natural language, which message kinds it accepts, and a one-line scope a
  router can match on — the same idea as the agent's own scope ladder
  (docs/adr/0001), one level down.
