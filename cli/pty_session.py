"""Run an interactive CLI (Codex's TUI, anything) inside a pseudo-terminal
owned by `las`, and type mailbox messages into it.

Why: a TUI has no API to receive a message from outside — Codex has no
equivalent of Claude Code's channels — but every TUI reads its keyboard.
So `las codex` puts `codex --yolo` behind a PTY that `las` controls: the
human's real terminal is forwarded byte for byte in both directions
(raw mode, window size, resize), and whenever the bridge hands over a
mailbox message, it is written into the PTY as a bracketed paste followed
by Enter — exactly what the TUI sees when a person pastes and submits.
Stdlib only (pty/tty/termios/select), no native module, no AppleScript,
works for any interactive program.

Limits, stated plainly: this is one-way (what the TUI answers stays on
screen; nothing is sent back to the sender), and a message that lands while
the human is mid-sentence is appended to what they were typing. The
two-way, thread-aware integration is Codex's experimental app-server
(docs/adr/0004 phase 3); this is the terminal the user asked for today.
