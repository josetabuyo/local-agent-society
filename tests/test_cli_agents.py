"""
Regression test for the "swallowed SystemExit" bug in cli/commands/agents.py.

`cli.api.get`/`post`/etc. print an error and `sys.exit(1)` (raising SystemExit)
when the backend is unreachable or returns an HTTP error. `agent new` used to
catch that SystemExit around the locale lookup and silently fall back to
"en-US", so the command reported success (exit code 0) even though the
backend call actually failed. This test asserts the failure now propagates.
