"""
vortexia_client.py — thin Python client for the vortexia MQTT broker.

Mirrors the JS client's API (register/send) and adds a poll-and-collect
helper for one-shot CLI invocations that can't stay subscribed forever.

Vendored copy of vortexia's python/vortexia_client.py (sibling project at
../vortexia, synced 2026-09-23 at its commit e667707). Kept in sync by hand
since the two repos aren't packaged together — see
/Users/josetabuyo/Development/vortexia/PROTOCOL.md for the protocol. The only
LAS-only addition is resolve_mqtt_port/default_port_file_candidates (broker
port discovery); everything else must stay byte-identical to upstream.

Requires `paho-mqtt` — a real dependency of this backend, see
backend/requirements.txt.

Topic schema (see PROTOCOL.md):
    las/agent/<name>/inbox      - direct message to one agent
    las/broadcast               - message to all agents
    las/agent/<name>/presence   - retained LWT presence ("online"/"offline")
    las/agent/<name>/session    - retained, broker-published: is the
                                  mailbox consumer connected right now?

Message envelope (JSON): {id, from, to, source, text, ts}

Mailboxes (PROTOCOL.md "Mailboxes"): every inbox is backed by an MQTT
persistent session with the client id `las-agent-<name>`. Whoever connects
with that id and clean_session=False is THE consumer of that inbox: it
receives everything queued while nobody was connected, in order, and each
message is consumed by being acknowledged. A viewer (any other client id,
clean session) sees live traffic and consumes nothing. Inbox publishes are
plain QoS 1 — never retained.

    client.js precedence: vortexia.port.json -> port registry -> DEFAULT_PORT.

    Why the port file comes first: vortexia claims its ports from the :8700
    registry at startup, and falls back to 1883 when the registry isn't up
    yet. On a cold boot both services are launchd jobs racing each other, so
    the broker can easily end up on 1883 while the registry still holds a
    stale claim (9014) from the previous run — every backend/CLI publish then
    goes to a port nobody listens on and vortexia is "unreachable" even
    though it's running fine (seen 2026-09-23). vortexia.port.json is written
    by the live broker *after* it binds, with its pid, so it's the
    authoritative answer whenever that pid is still alive.

    `ports` is the registry's ports.json content; `port_file_candidates` is an
    ordered list of paths to try for vortexia.port.json. Both default to what
    this checkout can see (see default_port_file_candidates()). `default` is
    returned when neither source knows a broker — pass None to be told that
    instead of getting the 1883 guess (e.g. a command that must fail soft
