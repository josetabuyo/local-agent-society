# The queue only keeps voices from colliding if draining it is paced by
# actual PLAYBACK, not by publish speed. Playback happens inside each agent's
# own Electron widget (one process per agent — see widget-electron/main.js's
# userData scoping), so nothing in this process can hear a clip end: the
# widget has to say so. Every speak envelope therefore carries an `id`, and
# the widget that picks it up acks it back over POST /queue/ack in phases:
#
#   started — "a widget has this one" (sent on receipt, before synthesis)
#   done    — playback finished
#   skipped — muted / no voice / synthesis or playback failed: the speaker is
#             free now, same as done
#
# _drain_one() publishes ONE envelope and then blocks until done/skipped
# before it touches the next queue entry — that is the whole serialization.
# Two safety valves keep one absent widget from stalling everyone else's
# speech: if nobody claims the message within SPEAK_PICKUP_GRACE_S (widget
# closed, a stale pre-handshake build, vortexia down) the drainer logs it
# and moves on at once; and once claimed, a per-message ceiling scaled by
# text length (capped at SPEAK_MAX_WAIT_S) covers a widget that died
# mid-clip.
#
# Before this handshake the loop popped and published as fast as it could,
# so N agents reporting in the same second produced N overlapping voices —

#
# One agent, several runtimes at once: a Claude session, a Codex session, a
# plain shell — each registered here by its bridge (bridge/) with a session
# id, runtime, pid and cwd. The DEFAULT session is the last one used
# (highest lastActiveAt); it is the one that holds the agent-level mailbox,
# so a plain `send --to Name` reaches it. The backend publishes the default's
# id, retained, on las/agent/<name>/default-session every time it changes:
# that is how a bridge learns whether to hold or release the agent mailbox
# without any bridge talking to another. Sessions whose process is gone are
# pruned on every read — a crashed bridge can't hold the default forever.

    multiple agents respond — see VortexRelayBridge._onLocalMessage's
    pickTargets in vortexia/src/vortex-relay/bridge.js) must be given; the
    caller validates that, not this function.

    - `to="Name"` — local registry lookup first (unqualified names only;
      "Name@env" always skips straight to vortex-relay, since a local
      registry entry can't be qualified). Falls back to a vortex-relay-direct
      publish (kind=vortex-relay-direct) to this environment's own gateway
      inbox when not found locally, or when explicitly qualified with
      "Name@env" to disambiguate a collision (two environments with an
      agent of the same name) — see resolveDirectoryName in
      vortexia/src/vortex-relay/directory.js.
    - `scope="free text"` — always goes through the gateway as a
      vortex-relay-intent envelope; there's no local-only equivalent of
      scope/embedding-based matching outside the bridge, so this mode
      requires VORTEXIA_ENV_NAME regardless of whether the eventual
      match(es) turn out to be local or remote. Zero, one, or several
      agents may reply — each reply is just a normal message back to the
      sender, no separate fan-in mechanism.

    Delivery is fire-and-forget in every case: a vortex-relay-direct send to
    an unresolvable name comes back as an async `vortex-relay-direct-error`
    reply to the sender, not a synchronous failure here — this can't tell
    "wrong name" apart from "right name, recipient just hasn't polled yet"
    any more than a local send ever could.

    Vortex-relay-direct/intent publishes are non-retained (unlike the local
    case): the gateway is a live, always-connected process supervised by
    launchd, not a session that polls later (see
    docs/adr/0002-service-persistence-and-logging.md) — and unlike
    `las agent listen`/poll_inbox, nothing on the bridge side clears a
    retained flag on receipt, so a retained publish here would replay into
    the bridge on every vortexia restart.

    Returns {ok, injected, mode: "direct"|"scope", relayed}. Raises
    HTTPException on a configuration error (no `to`/`scope` resolution
    possible without vortex-relay).
